EXCEL INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD

Unlocking Insights with Excel: Interactive Dashboard Project

I'm excited to share a recent project where I built an interactive dashboard in Excel, a powerful tool that transforms raw data into clear, dynamic visuals.

Using PivotTables, slicers, dropdown filters, or conditional formatting, you can create a user-friendly dashboard that lets users explore key metrics with just a few clicks.

This type of dashboard is ideal for:

->Making data-driven decisions quickly

->Presenting insights in a visually compelling way
